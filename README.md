# minorproject

About the Project:

This is my Minor Project for the Embedded Systems course. The project is built using microcontrollers and IoT concepts to solve a real-world problem in a simple and efficient way.
The aim of this project is to:
Demonstrate embedded system design skills
Apply microcontroller programming knowledge
Implement real-time monitoring and control features
Provide a low-cost and scalable solution

Features:
 Simple hardware setup using Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32
 Real-time monitoring of sensors
 Automated control based on conditions
 Easy-to-use interface (LEDs/LCD/Web/Mobile)
 Energy-efficient and cost-effective design

How It Works:
Sensors collect input data (temperature, light, motion, etc.).
The microcontroller processes this input.
Based on conditions, it triggers actuators (relays, motors, alarms, etc.).
The system provides feedback through LEDs, LCD, or an app.

Hardware Used:
Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32
Relevant sensors (depending on project idea)
Relay modules or actuators
LCD / LEDs for output
Power supply

Software:
Arduino IDE (Embedded C/C++)
Communication protocol (Wi-Fi / Bluetooth )

Results:
 Working prototype of the system
 Demonstrated real-time monitoring & control
 Low cost, scalable solution for future upgrades
