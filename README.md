About the Project

This project is a Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) built using microcontrollers and IoT components.
The main goal is to optimize household electricity usage by monitoring, automating, and controlling appliances in real time.

With electricity costs on the rise, this system helps:
Reduce energy wastage
Save money by shifting loads to non-peak hours
Give homeowners full control over their appliances from a simple interface

Features:
 Real-time monitoring of energy consumption
 Automated appliance scheduling
 Load shifting during peak hours
 Remote control via mobile/web app
 Scalable design for different types of homes
 
 How It Works:
Sensors collect data (e.g., current, temperature, motion).
A microcontroller (Arduino / ESP32 / ESP8266) processes the data.
Data is sent via Wi-Fi/ZigBee to the cloud.
The system makes decisions (e.g., when to turn appliances ON/OFF).
Homeowners can check everything on a web or mobile dashboard.

Hardware Used:
Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32 (microcontroller)
Current & voltage sensors
Relay modules for controlling appliances
Wi-Fi/ZigBee communication modules
Power supply

Software:
Arduino IDE (Embedded C / C++)
Cloud services (for storage & real-time updates)

Results:
 Lower electricity bills by reducing unnecessary usage
 Better efficiency through smart scheduling
 Simple UI for monitoring and control
 Environment-friendly by avoiding wastage
